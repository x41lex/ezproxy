Test using a windows proxy (Search 'Proxy')

Socks5 support (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928)

For UDP there could a socks-esc thing where you use the API to open a new UDP connection (Like you do in SOCKS) we can 
connect to & use that for UDP.


For the UDP socks-esc thing we will use TCP to send data over UDP (So its stateful)

1. Send a request to the API / WebSocket / Proxy (The 'Source' for now on)
2. EzProxy will verify the request and will setup a IP:PORT it will wait for a connection on
3. If the connection is not established in a given timeout the connection will close
4. After a single connection is connected EzProxy will stop listening
5. Data can now be tramsited via this IP & will be forwarded 

This will work nicely sometimes, but for when it *must* be UDP we will

1. Send a request to the source
2. EzProxy will verify the request, then wait on a UDP port, a timeout will still be used
3. EzProxy will only allow data & reply on the first address that connects
4. Data can be transmitted, after a configured timeout of no contact this UDP connection will be pruned

I think to coexist with other proxies now we need a better proxy dispatcher

My idea is to have a priority based approach along with filtering for instance built in filters might be 

```go
// Assume this flags in a bitfield
const (
    // Not bitfield
    ProtocolTcp
    ProtocolUdp
)
```

The priority may look like 

```go
func RegisterDispatcher(dispatchFunc func(), proto Protcol, priority uint, filterFunc func())


RegisterDispatcher(tcpConnection, ProtocolTcp, 0, nil)
RegisterDispatcher(udpConnection, ProtocolUdp, 0, nil)
// Higher priority goes first, so this is called first then falls through
RegisterDispatcher(tcpOverUdpConnection, ProtocolTcp, 1, isTcpOverUdp)
```

We'd figure out what we need to open based on the protcool flags, if we have ProtocolTcp we'd open a TCP listener, same with UDP, we could add these as interfaces, but I might just do them hard coded because I dont see what other layer 4 protocols I'm going to implement.

Changes need to made to a **lot** of stuff, for starters

* proxy/udp & proxy/tcp both need to have there listeners removed
* IConnectionAdder is going to be removed, and `AddConnection` will need a entire rework
* Listeners need be added
